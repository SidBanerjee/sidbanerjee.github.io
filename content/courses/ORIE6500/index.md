## Course Description

This is a graduate course which aims to provide a non measure-theoretic introduction to stochastic processes, presenting the basic theory together with a variety of applications.
Students are assumed to have taken at least a one-semester undergraduate course in probability, and ideally, have some background in real analysis. 
We will focus on the following primary topics  

1. **Fundamental tools and methods**: Basic concepts (integration, transforms, inequalities, convergence) and more advanced probabilistic tools (coupling and stochastic ordering, martingales, renewal theory, spectral methods).  

2. **Markovian models**: Discrete-time Markov chains, recurrence and transience, invariant distributions, the ergodic theorem, reversibility, Lyapunov functions, Markov chain mixing, Poisson processes and continuous-time Markov chains.  

In addition, we will illustrate these tools with applications in a variety of settings, depending on time and student interest:  

1. **Fundamental Probabilistic Models**: Balls and bins, the Galton Watson branching process, the Erdos-Renyi graph, queueing networks, epidemics and percolation.  

2. **Algorithmic Applications:** Basics of randomized algorithms, the probabilistic method, Monte Carlo simulation and sampling, applications in distributed algorithms, data sketching, optimization and machine learning.

## References

The course will primarily be based on the following two textbooks (both by Pierre Bremaud):

1. [Discrete Probability Models and Methods](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/9852199) (for majority of topics)
2. [Markov chains: Gibbs fields, Monte Carlo simulation, and Queues](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/10190721) (for CTMCs)
An e-copy of the book is available on the Cornell library website, which also gives you access to a low-price MyCopy edition from the Springer website.
