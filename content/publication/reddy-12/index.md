abstract = "We study the problem of distributed scheduling in wireless networks, where each node makes individual scheduling decisions based on heterogeneously delayed network state information (NSI). This leads to inconsistency in the views of the network across nodes, which, coupled with interference, makes it challenging to schedule for high throughputs.\n\n We characterize the network throughput region for this setup, and develop optimal scheduling policies to achieve the same. Our scheduling policies have a threshold-based structure and, moreover, require the nodes to use only the ?smallest critical subset? of the available delayed NSI to make decisions. In addition, using Markov chain mixing techniques, we quantify the impact of delayed NSI on the throughput region. This not only highlights the value of extra NSI for scheduling, but also characterizes the loss in throughput incurred by lower complexity scheduling policies which use homogeneously delayed NSI."
