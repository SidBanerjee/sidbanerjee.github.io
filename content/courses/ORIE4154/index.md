## Course Description

This course will expose students to modeling and optimization techniques which can be used to design the firm-market interface. In particular, this interface can take two forms:

- **Revenue management**: How to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price.
- **Marketplace design**: Determining who gets what and why (and at what price) in two-sided platform marketplaces.

We will draw on a rich body of research spanning three disciplines - operations management, economics and computer science - and study a collection of related (yet diverse) mathematical models and techniques. The models we cover have proved successful in practice across various industries; however, given the transformations brought about by the advent of online commerce and increased use of smartphones, our aim is to provide students with tools that generalize to new domains.
