The goods arrive in a sequence of $T$ periods and the value of each agent for a good is adversarially chosen when the good arrives. We first observe that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than the trivial $O(N)$, unless it is given additional information about the agents' values. Then, in line with the emerging area of \"algorithms with predictions\", we consider a setting where for each agent, the online algorithm is only given a prediction of her *monopolist utility*, i.e., her utility if all goods were given to her alone (corresponding to the sum of her values over the $T$ periods). Our main result is an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is parameterized by the multiplicative errors in these predictions. The algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $O(\\log N)$ and $O(\\log T)$ if the predictions are perfectly accurate. Moreover, the competitive ratio degrades smoothly with the errors in the predictions, and is surprisingly robust: the logarithmic competitive ratio holds even if the predictions are very inaccurate. We complement this positive result by showing that our bounds are essentially tight: no online algorithm, even if provided with perfectly accurate predictions, can achieve a competitive ratio of $O((\\log N)^{1−\\epsilon})$ or $O((\\log T)^{1-\\epsilon})$ for any constant $\\epsilon 0$.","tags":["market design","fair allocation"],"title":"Online Nash Social Welfare with Predictions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Sinclair","Siddhartha Banerjee","Christina Lee Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633233600,"objectID":"722e653378d195505c1db514f9343aa6","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/sinclair-22-sigmetrics/","publishdate":"2021-10-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/sinclair-22-sigmetrics/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of dividing limited resources to individuals arriving over $T$ rounds. Each round has a random number of individuals arrive, and individuals can be characterized by their type (i.e. preferences over the different resources). A standard notion of 'fairness' in this setting is that an allocation simultaneously satisfy envy-freeness and efficiency. The former is an individual guarantee, requiring that each agent prefers her own allocation over the allocation of any other; in contrast, efficiency is a global property, requiring that the allocations clear the available resources. For divisible resources, when the number of individuals of each type are known upfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable for a large class of utility functions. However, in an online setting when the number of individuals of each type are only revealed round by round, no policy can guarantee these desiderata simultaneously, and hence the best one can do is to try and allocate so as to approximately satisfy the two properties.\n\n We show that in the online setting, the two desired properties (envy-freeness and efficiency) are in direct contention, in that any algorithm achieving additive envy-freeness up to a factor of $L_T$  *necessarily suffers an efficiency loss of at least* $1/L_T$. We complement this uncertainty principle with a simple algorithm, HopeGuardrail, which allocates resources based on an adaptive threshold policy. We show that our algorithm is able to achieve any fairness-efficiency point on this frontier, and moreover, in simulation results, provides allocations close to the optimal fair solution in hindsight. This motivates its use in practical applications, as the algorithm is able to adapt to any desired fairness efficiency trade-off.","tags":["online decision-making","fair allocation"],"title":"Sequential Fair Allocation: Achieving the Optimal Envy-Efficiency Tradeoff Curve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chamsi Hssaine","Siddhartha Banerjee","Vijay Kamble"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630468800,"objectID":"6afb4f0105d5e1c6183257fe05bbb678","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/hssaine-21-satisficing/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/hssaine-21-satisficing/","section":"publication","summary":"We study a game of price competition amongst firms selling homogeneous goods defined by the property that a firm's revenue is independent of any competing prices that are strictly lower. This property is induced by any customer choice model involving utility-maximizing choice from an adaptively determined consideration set, encompassing a variety of empirically validated choice models studied in the literature.\n\n For these games, we show a one-to-one correspondence between pure-strategy local Nash equilibria with distinct prices and the prices generated by the firms sequentially setting local best-response prices in different orders. In other words, despite being simultaneous-move games, they have a sequential-move equilibrium structure. Although this structure is attractive from a computational standpoint, we find that it makes these games particularly vulnerable to the existence of strictly-local Nash equilibria, in which the price of a firm is only a local best-response to competitors' prices when a globally optimal response with a potentially unboundedly higher payoff is available. Our results thus suggest that strictly-local Nash equilibria may be more prevalent in competitive settings than anticipated. We moreover show, both theoretically and empirically, that price dynamics resulting from the firms utilizing gradient-based dynamic pricing algorithms to respond to competition may often converge to such an undesirable outcome. We finally propose an algorithmic approach that incorporates global experimentation to address this concern under certain regularity assumptions on the revenue curves.

The products have (real-valued) qualities, which are drawn i.i.d. from a common prior. The principal aims to choose the better of the two products, but the quality of a product can only be estimated via a coarse-grained *threshold test*: given a threshold $\\theta$, the principal learns whether a product's quality exceeds $\\theta$ or fails to do so.\n\n We study this selection problem under two types of interactions. In the first, the principal does the testing herself, and can choose tests optimally from a class of allowable tests. We show that the optimum strategy for the principal is to administer *different* tests to the two products: one which is passed with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the other with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. If, however, the principal is required to choose the tests in a symmetric manner (i.e., via an i.i.d. distribution), then the optimal strategy is to choose tests whose probability of passing is drawn uniformly from $[\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4}]$. \n\n In our second interaction model, test difficulties are selected endogenously by the two firms. This corresponds to a setting in which the firms must commit to their testing (quality control) procedures before knowing the quality of their products. This interaction model naturally gives rise to a *signaling game* with two senders and one receiver. We characterize the unique Bayes-Nash Equilibrium of this game, which happens to be symmetric. We then calculate its Price of Anarchy in terms of the principal's probability of choosing the worse product. Finally, we show that by restricting both firms' set of available thresholds to choose from, the principal can lower the Price of Anarchy of the resulting equilibrium; however, there is a limit, in that for every (common) restricted set of tests, the equilibrium failure probability is strictly larger than under the optimal i.i.d. distribution.","tags":["information structures","market design"],"title":"Threshold Tests as Quality Signals: Optimal Strategies, Equilibria, and Price of Anarchy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur Gorokh","Siddhartha Banerjee","Krishnamurthy Iyer"],"categories":null,"content":"Earlier version: Scrip Economies are Fair and (Approximately) Efficient.\n","date":1622520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622520000,"objectID":"e2740c53efd3466bc1ed5e11792686b2","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/gorokh-21-scrip/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/gorokh-21-scrip/","section":"publication","summary":"In many settings, resources are allocated among agents repeatedly over time without the use of monetary transfers: consider, for example, allocating server-time to company employees, rooms to students, or food among food banks. Here, the central challenge is to allocate resources efficiently despite the absence of payments. In this work we study a simple online variant of the standard Fisher market, where we endow all agents with a budget of artificial credits, and then repeatedly run simultaneous first-price auctions for each item in each period. Owing to their simplicity, such mechanisms have been gaining in popularity, with several recent successful implementations, most notably, by Feeding America for US food banks. Our goal in this paper is to understand the incentive and efficiency properties of these mechanisms.\n\n  Our main contribution in this work is to show that such simple mechanisms enjoy strong performance guarantees under minimal rationality assumptions. Formally, we consider a dynamic allocation setting, where multiple items are available in each period, and each agent’s preference is a fractionally subadditive (XOS) valuation function, drawn independently from some underlying distributions. Agents start with some initial endowment of credits, and in each round, participate in simultaneous first-price auctions for each item. We benchmark the performance this mechanism against widely-adopted solution concepts from the literature on bargaining. In particular, we show that irrespective of the strategies of other agents, each agent can obtain a $\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)$ approximation of their ideal utility, i.e., the utility they derive from their favorite allocation subject to giving other agents their share (proportional to initial endowments) of the items. We do this by providing a lower-bound on the maximum value of each agent in the mechanism. \n\n Our results provide strong argument for a wider adoption of artificial currency mechanisms in several ways. First, our guarantees have frugal strategic and informational requirements – agents do not need to know the preferences or strategies of other participants in order to secure a half of their ideal utility. Second, the performance guarantees are independent of the cardinality of the type-space, and agnostic of the underlying type distributions. Finally, our results also yield operational insights into how the principal can choose the appropriate credit endowments in order to target a particular ideal utility profile.","tags":["market design","fair allocation"],"title":"The Remarkable Robustness of the Repeated Fisher Market","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee","Daniel Freund","Thodoris Lykouris"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617249600,"objectID":"90990195735cebb8e29638ea1bd2e8a1","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/freund-21/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/freund-21/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimizing shared vehicle systems (bike/scooter/car/ride-sharing) is more challenging compared to traditional resource allocation settings due to the presence of *complex network externalities* -- changes in the demand/supply at any location affect future supply throughout the system within short timescales. These externalities are well captured by steady-state Markovian models, which are therefore widely used to analyze such systems. However, using such models to design pricing and other control policies is computationally difficult since the resulting optimization problems are high-dimensional and non-convex.\n\n To this end, we develop a *rigorous approximation framework* for shared vehicle systems, providing a unified approach for a wide range of controls (pricing, matching, rebalancing), objective functions (throughput, revenue, welfare), and system constraints (travel-times, welfare benchmarks, posted-price constraints). Our approach is based on the analysis of natural convex relaxations, and obtains as special cases existing approximate-optimal policies for limited settings, asymptotic-optimality results, and heuristic policies. The resulting guarantees are non-asymptotic and parametric, and provide operational insights into the design of real-world systems. In particular, for any shared vehicle system with $n$ stations and $m$ vehicles, our framework obtains an approximation ratio of $1+(n-1)//m$, which is particularly meaningful when $m/n$, the average number of vehicles per station, is large, as is often the case in practice.","tags":["online decision-making","market-design"],"title":"Pricing and Optimization in Shared Vehicle Systems: An Approximation Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee","Chamsi Hssaine","Noemie Perivier","Samitha Samaranayake"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614574800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614574800,"objectID":"2d07f076e25a77d2ec45a8afb9f71db3","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/perivier-21-pomacs/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/perivier-21-pomacs/","section":"publication","summary":"We study real-time routing policies in smart transit systems, where the platform has a combination of cars and high-capacity vehicles (e.g., buses or shuttles) and seeks to serve a set of incoming trip requests.

Our work makes two contributions in this regard:\n\n 1. We propose a scalable algorithm for CSP queries, and show how its performance can be parametrized in terms of a new network primitive, the constrained highway dimension. This development is analogous to recent work which established the highway dimension as the appropriate primitive for characterizing the performance of existing shortest-path (SP) algorithms. Our main theoretical contribution is deriving conditions relating the two notions, thereby providing a characterization of networks where CSP and SP queries are of comparable hardness.\n\n2. We develop practical algorithms for scalable CSP computation, augmenting our theory with additional network clustering heuristics. We evaluate these algorithms on real-world datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

Formally, we consider the standard single-item auction, with a revenue-maximizing seller and n buyers with independent private values; in addition, we now have an intermediary who knows the buyers' true values, and can map these to a public signal so as to try to increase buyer surplus. This model was proposed by Bergemann et al., who present a signaling scheme for the single-buyer setting that raises the optimal consumer surplus, by guaranteeing the item is always sold while ensuring the seller gets the same revenue as without signaling. Our work aims to understand how this result ports to the setting with multiple buyers.\n\n Our first result is an impossibility: We show that such a signaling scheme need not exist even for $n=2$ buyers with $2$-point valuation distributions. Indeed, no signaling scheme can always allocate the item to the highest-valued buyer while preserving any non-trivial fraction of the original consumer surplus; further, no signaling scheme can achieve consumer surplus better than a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ compared to the maximum achievable. These results are existential (and not computational) impossibilities, and thus provide a sharp separation between the single and multi-buyer settings.\n\n On the positive side, for discrete valuation distributions, we develop signaling schemes with good approximation guarantees for the consumer surplus compared to the maximum achievable, in settings where either the number of agents, or the support size of valuations, is small. Formally, for i.i.d. buyers, we present an $O(\\min(\\log n,K))$-approximation where $K$ is the support size of the valuations. Moreover, for general distributions, we present an $O(\\min(n\\log n,K^2))$-approximation. Our signaling schemes are conceptually simple and computable in polynomial (in $n$ and $K$) time.","tags":["market-design","information-structures"],"title":"The Limits of an Information Intermediary in Auction Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":" Course Syllabus\n           Random Spanning Tree via Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm    Course Description Intro to Monte Carlo techniques and stochastic simulation.

You should be automatically signed up for this (please tell us immediately if not). iClicker: Students must use the REEF Polling app for in-class tests. Please see the following instructions.    Course Material --  Course notes: These will be uploaded on Piazza before the class. Students are encouraged to annotate them.\n Textbook: Simulation by Ross; This is the suggested textbook for the course. An e-copy is available online on the Cornell library website.\n Coding Resources:\nThe assignments in the first half of semester can be done in any high-level language; our recommendation is for using Python (in particular, we will use Python 3.6 for our solutions) and Jupyter notebooks.\n For desktop use, we recommend installing a package manager like Anaconda, which installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages. For coding online, we highly recommend Google Colab (this is also great for collaboration with teammates). The python tutorial is a good place to look up basic and advanced syntax. It should help you map other programming knowledge you have to Python. The power of Python lies in its many packages - use library reference to find standard library modules to help get your work done quickly. Additional packages we will use extensively are NumPy, SciPy (and also SimPy for DES). There are many more functions in scipy and numpy than you can remember, so for a given task look at the scipy reference or numpy reference to find the tool you are looking for. Also, read numpy for MATLAB users if you are familiar with MATLAB. For visualization, we will use Matplotlib and Seaborn. Matplotlib has many built-in plotting capabilities, and the matplotlib gallery is a good way to find code snippets for tasks similar to what you need. Seaborn is another great visualization package for data analysis - less powerful in general, but easier to use for standard tasks. Finally, searching online for a task often brings up excellent suggestions in sites like StackExchange. Get used to using this!  In the second half of semester, we will briefly look at a commercial simulation package, Simio. This only operates on PCs, or on Macs running Windows. Simio is available in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall. Students may consider obtaining the student version of Simio ($25, available here) - this imposes limits on the size of the models, but should be sufficient for our course.\n  ","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597622400,"objectID":"c71f456c0c174e57e436371a26edf6fa","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/courses/orie4580f20/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/public/courses/orie4580f20/","section":"courses","summary":"Course Syllabus\n           Random Spanning Tree via Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm    Course Description Intro to Monte Carlo techniques and stochastic simulation.

In particular, we focus on the design of assignment policies, wherein the platform can choose which supply unit to dispatch to meet an incoming customer request. The supply unit subsequently becomes available at the destination after dropping the customer. We consider the proportion of dropped demand in steady state as the performance measure. We propose a family of simple and explicit state dependent policies called Scaled MaxWeight (SMW) policies and prove that under the complete resource pooling (CRP) condition (analogous to a strict version of Hall's condition for bipartite matchings), any SMW policy induces an exponential decay of demand-dropping probability as the number of supply units scales to infinity. Furthermore, we show that there is an SMW policy that achieves the optimal exponent among all assignment policies, and analytically specify this policy in terms of the matrix of customer-request arrival rates. The optimal SMW policy protects structurally under-supplied locations.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Assignment Control of a Closed Queueing Network under Complete Resource Pooling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Sinclair","Tianyu Wang","Gauri Jain","Siddhartha Banerjee","Christina Lee Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591761600,"objectID":"bfee23db46256d69f63853b50ff3ac9e","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/sinclair-20-neurips/","publishdate":"2020-06-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/sinclair-20-neurips/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce the technique of adaptive discretization to design efficient model-based episodic reinforcement learning algorithms in large (potentially continuous) state-action spaces.

From an implementation standpoint, our algorithm has much lower storage and computational requirements, due to maintaining a more efficient partition of the state and action spaces. We illustrate this via experiments on several canonical control problems, which shows that our algorithm empirically performs significantly better than fixed discretization in terms of both faster convergence and lower memory usage.

Our framework is based on Bellman Inequalities, which decompose the loss of an algorithm into two distinct sources of error: (1) arising from computational tractability issues, and (2) arising from estimation/prediction of random trajectories. Balancing these errors guides the choice of benchmarks, and leads to policies that are both tractable and have strong performance guarantees.

Second, using this technique, we show that a natural greedy policy, which we call *the Bayes Selector*, has constant expected regret (i.e., independent of the number of arrivals and resource levels) for a large class of problems we refer to as Online Allocation with finite types, which includes widely-studied Online Packing and Online Matching problems. Our results generalize and simplify several existing results for Online Packing and Online Matching, and suggest a promising pathway for obtaining oracle-driven policies for other online decision-making settings.","tags":["online decision-making"],"title":"The Bayesian Prophet: A Low-Regret Framework for Online Decision Making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Sinclair","Siddhartha Banerjee","Christina Lee Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"Journal version of Sinclair et al.

Our algorithm is based on a novel Q-learning policy with adaptive data-driven discretization. The central idea is to maintain a finer partition of the state-action space in regions which are frequently visited in historical trajectories, and have higher payoff estimates. We demonstrate how our adaptive partitions take advantage of the shape of the optimal Q-function and the joint space, without sacrificing the worst-case performance. In particular, we recover the regret guarantees of prior algorithms for continuous state-action spaces, which additionally require either an optimal discretization as input, and/or access to a simulation oracle. Moreover, experiments demonstrate how our algorithm automatically adapts to the underlying structure of the problem, resulting in much better performance compared both to heuristics and Q-learning with uniform discretization.","tags":["online decision-making"],"title":"Adaptive Discretization for Episodic Reinforcement Learning in Metric Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":" Course Description This is a graduate course which aims to provide a non measure-theoretic introduction to stochastic processes, presenting the basic theory together with a variety of applications.

This is an important consideration in settings such as crowdsourcing competitions, open science challenges and group-based assignments, where a large number of agents organize themselves into small teams which then compete against each other. A central tension here is between the strategic interests of agents who want to have the highest-performing team, and that of the principal who wants teams to be balanced. Moreover, although the principal cannot choose the teams or modify rewards, she often has additional knowledge of agents' abilities, and can leverage this information asymmetry to provide signals that influence team formation. Our work uncovers the critical role of self-awareness (i.e., knowledge of one's own abilities) for the design of such mechanisms. For settings with two-member teams and binary-valued agents partitioned into a constant number of prior classes, we provide signaling mechanisms which are asymptotically optimal when agents are agnostic of their own abilities. On the other hand, when agents are self-aware, then we show that there is no signaling mechanism that can do better than not releasing information, while satisfying agent participation constraints.","tags":["information structures"],"title":"Information signal design for incentivizing team formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":" Course Description Simulation is a general technique of using computer-generated models for counter-factual analysis (i.e., answering what-if questions) of complex real-world systems. In other words, our focus will be on data-driven engineering - going beyond learning from data (\u0026lsquo;data-science\u0026rsquo;) to using data to design and improve complex systems.\nThere are many different simulation techniques across different fields. Our focus will be on stochastic simulation; in particular, we will cover two topics:\n Monte Carlo simulation: for the first part of the course, we will focus on simulating systems in which time does not play a substantive role. Discrete-event simulation: in the second half, we will model systems with uncertainty that evolve over time.  Stochastic simulation deals with predicting certain aspects of the behavior of some complex system through approximate models. Manufacturers use simulation to model factory staffing, conveyors, automated guided vehicles, storage and retrieval systems. Airlines and transportation companies use simulation to model fleet logistics and traffic. Designers of communications networks and computer systems use simulation to model data transmission and processing. Health care providers use simulation to model medicine and staff levels and placement in hospitals and pharmacies. Epidemiologists use simulation to model spread of diseases. The defense community uses simulation to model aircraft readiness and combat strategy. In public services, simulation is used to model police, fire fighting, ambulance and judicial systems. Many aspects of financial, marketing and information systems can be studied using simulation. information systems can be studied using simulation.\n Course Syllabus  Course Information  Lectures: TR 1.25pm-2.40pm, Kimball B11 Instructor: Sid Banerjee, 229 Rhodes Hall, email Teaching Assistants:\n Chamsi Hssaine Marc Finzi Venus Lo Auston Li Cean Park Eric Wu Evan Solomonides\nRecitation and office hours schedule available on Piazza.\n  Course Logistics:\n Piazza: All class announcements and resources will be posted on Piazza. Please sign up for the course immediately if you have not done so. CMS: All homework submissions must be done electronically via CMS. You should be automatically signed up for this - please tell us immediately if this is not the case. iClicker or iClicker App: Students are required to either have iClickers or the REEF Polling app for the course. Please see the following instructions, or consult the support site.   Course Material  Course notes: These will be uploaded on Piazza a week before the class. Students are encouraged to bring copies to class to annotate them. Textbook: Simulation by Ross; This is the suggested textbook for the course. An e-copy is available online on the Cornell library website.\n Other References: The following books (available online on the Cornell library website) are good references for the material we will cover.\n Discrete-Event System Simulation by Banks et al. Simulation Modeling and Analysis by Law Foundations and Methods of Stochastic Simulation by Nelson Handbook of Simulation by Banks Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering by Glasserman\n  Coding Resources:\nThe assignments in the first half of semester can be done in any high-level language; our recommendation is for using Python (in particular, we will use Python 3.6 for our solutions) and Jupyter notebooks. These are installed in the labs in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall.\n For students using these for the first time, we highly recommend installing a packaga manager like Anaconda, which conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. The python tutorial is a good place to look up basic and advanced syntax. It should help you map other programming knowledge to Python, and learn the basic data types. Use library reference to find standard library modules to help get your work done quickly. The power of Python lies in the many packages that are available for different applications - we in particular will extensively use numpy, scipy and Matplotlib. Use library reference to find standard library modules to help get your work done quickly. Read numpy for MATLAB users if you are familiar with MATLAB. There are many more functions in scipy and numpy than you can remember. For a given task, you can look at the scipy reference or numpy reference to find the tool you are looking for. More generally, searching online for a task often brings up excellent suggestions in sites like StackExchange. Matplotlib has many built-in plotting capabilities. Usually, I use the matplotlib gallery to find something similar to what I want, and edit the code provided there. Another great visualization package is Seaborn.  In the second half of semester, we will work with a commercial simulation package, Simio, which only operates on PCs, or on Macs running Windows. Simio is available in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall. Students may consider obtaining the student version of Simio ($25, available here) - this imposes limits on the size of the models, but should be sufficient for the homework or project. The Simio software includes documentation.\n  Prerequisites Familiarity with the topics covered in ENGRD 2700 and ORIE 3500\u0026frasl;5500 is required, but ORIE 3500\u0026frasl;5500 may be taken concurrently. The initial part of the course includes a short review of probability and statistics; if this material is unfamiliar to you, then you should study Chapters 1 through 6 of Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, 2nd ed., by Sheldon Ross, or Chapters 1-5 and Chapter 7 of Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences, 8th ed., by Devore. This material is standard, and can be found in other books at a similar level.\nThe course involves some coding, and some prior programming experience is useful. The programming in the first part of the course can be done using any high-level language of your choice (in particular, Python, MATLAB, R, Julia, C++ or Java); our preference is that students use Python, and submit iPython notebooks with annotated code and plots. There will be a recitation section introducing these for interested students, and students can use them in the lab computers in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall. The second half of the course will be based on Simio, a commercial simulation package, which we will teach in class.\n","date":1534723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545004800,"objectID":"da7f9c50384cf7442d7ea462954f973d","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/courses/orie4580f18/","publishdate":"2018-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/public/courses/orie4580f18/","section":"courses","summary":"Course Description Simulation is a general technique of using computer-generated models for counter-factual analysis (i.e., answering what-if questions) of complex real-world systems.

We propose a family of simple and explicit state dependent policies called Scaled MaxWeight (SMW) policies and prove that under the complete resource pooling (CRP) condition (analogous to a strict version of Hall's condition for bipartite matchings), any SMW policy induces an exponential decay of demand-dropping probability as the number of supply units scales to infinity. Furthermore, we show that there is an SMW policy that achieves the optimal exponent among all assignment policies, and analytically specify this policy in terms of the matrix of customer-request arrival rates.

Though a growing literature addresses the question of how to make individual MoD platforms more efficient, much less is known about the cost of market fragmentation, i.e., the impact on welfare due to splitting the demand between multiple independent platforms. Our work aims to quantify how much platform fragmentation degrades the efficiency of the system. In particular, we focus on a setting where demand is exogenously split between multiple platforms, and study the increase in the supply rebalancing cost incurred by each platform to meet this demand, vis-a-vis the cost incurred by a centralized platform serving the aggregate demand. We show under a large-market scaling, this Price-of-Fragmentation undergoes a phase transition, wherein, depending on the nature of the exogenous demand, the additional cost due to fragmentation either vanishes or grows unbounded.

The issue is more severe when monetary transfers (bribes) between agents are feasible, wherein it is known that truthful revelation and efficient allocation are incompatible. A natural relaxation that circumvents these impossibility results is that of coalitional dominance: replacing truthful revelation with the weaker requirement that all coalitions, whatever they may be, have dominant strategies. When a mechanism satisfies this property and is efficient, we call it collusion resilient. The goal of this paper is to characterize the power and limits of collusion resilient mechanisms.\n\n On the positive side, in a general allocation setting, we demonstrate a new mechanism which is collusion-resilient for surplus-submodular settings -- a large-class of problems which includes combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes valuations. We complement this mechanism with two impossibility results: (1) for combinatorial auctions with general submodular valuations, we show that no mechanism can be collusion-resilient, and (2) for the problem of collective decision making, we argue that any non-trivial approximation of welfare is impossible under coalitional dominance. Finally, we make a connection between collusion resilience and false-name-proofness, and show that our impossibility theorems strengthen existing results for false-name-proof mechanisms.","tags":null,"title":"When Bribes are Harmless: The Power and Limits of Collusion-Resilient Mechanism Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":" Course Description The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the theory of Markov chains, with an emphasis on their applications to algorithms, learning and control.

Though a growing literature addresses the question of how to make individual MoD platforms more efficient, much less is known about the cost of market fragmentation, i.e., the impact on welfare due to splitting the demand between multiple independent platforms. Our work aims to quantify how much platform fragmentation degrades the efficiency of the system. In particular, we focus on a setting where demand is exogenously split between multiple platforms, and study the increase in the supply rebalancing cost incurred by each platform to meet this demand, vis-a-vis the cost incurred by a centralized platform serving the aggregate demand. We show under a large-market scaling, this Price-of-Fragmentation undergoes a phase transition, wherein, depending on the nature of the exogenous demand, the additional cost due to fragmentation either vanishes or grows unbounded. We provide conditions that characterize which regime applies to any given system, and discuss implications of this on how such platforms should be regulated.","tags":null,"title":"The Price of Fragmentation in Mobility-on-Demand Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee","Sreenivas Gollapudi","Kostas Kollias","Kamesh Munagala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504238400,"objectID":"4de8b6be1d60eecf09a8c41a268a2240","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/munagala-17/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/munagala-17/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent years have witnessed the rise of many successful e-commerce marketplaces like the Amazon marketplace, Uber, AirBnB, and Upwork, where a central platform mediates economic transactions between buyers and sellers. A common feature of many of these two-sided marketplaces is that the platform has full control over search and discovery, but prices are determined by the buyers and sellers. Motivated by this, we study the algorithmic aspects of market segmentation via directed discovery in two-sided markets with endogenous prices. We consider a model where an online platform knows each buyer/seller's characteristics, and associated demand/supply elasticities. Moreover, the platform can use discovery mechanisms (search/recommendation/etc.) to control which buyers/sellers are visible to each other. This leads to a segmentation of the market into pools, following which buyers and sellers endogenously determine market-clearing transaction prices within each pool. The aim of the platform is to maximize the resulting volume of transactions/welfare in the market. We develop efficient algorithms with provable guarantees under a variety of assumptions on the demand and supply functions. We also test the validity of our assumptions on demand curves inferred from NYC taxicab log-data, as well as show the performance of our algorithms on synthetic experiments.","tags":["market design","fair allocation"],"title":"Segmenting Two-Sided Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":" Course Description Simulation is a general technique for answering \u0026lsquo;what-if questions\u0026rsquo; about complex real-world systems using computer-generated models.

Discrete-event simulation: in the second half, we will model systems that evolve over time, primarily using Simio a widely used simulation package.  Stochastic simulation deals with predicting certain aspects of the behavior of some system through approximate models. Manufacturers use simulation to model work cells, conveyors, auto- mated guided vehicles, storage and retrieval systems. Airlines and transportation companies use simulation to model fleet logistics and traffic. Designers of communications networks and computer systems use simulation to model data transmission and switching. Health care providers use simulation to model resource levels and placement in health care systems. Epidemiologists use simulation to model spread of diseases. The defense community uses simulation to model aircraft readiness and combat strategy. In public services, simulation is used to model police, fire fighting, ambulance and judicial systems. Many aspects of financial, marketing and information systems can be studied using simulation.\n Course Syllabus  Course Information  Lectures: TR 1.25pm-2.40pm, Hollister B14, Map Instructor: Sid Banerjee, 229 Rhodes Hall, email Teaching Assistants:\n David Eckman James Dong Ivy Wu James Dong Zeyu Huang Edmond Mui Matthew Dalton Judy Jiang\nRecitation and office hours schedule available on Piazza.\n  Course Logistics:\n Piazza: All class announcements and resources will be posted on Piazza. Please sign up for the course immediately if you have not done so. CMS: All homework submissions must be done electronically via CMS. You should be automatically signed up for this - please tell us immediately if this is not the case. iClicker or iClicker App: Students are required to either have iClickers or the REEF Polling app for the course. Please see the following instructions, or consult the support site.   Course Material  Course notes: These will be uploaded on Piazza a week before the class. Students are encouraged to bring copies to class to annotate them. Textbook:\n Simulation Modeling and Analysis by A. M. Law\nThis is the suggested textbook for the course. We recommend reading so that you will know which section to read if you buy the book. Feel free to purchase older editions of the textbook if you can find a more reasonably priced copy. The contents of the textbook change very little from one edition to the next.\n  Other References: The following books are good references for the material we will cover.\n Discrete-Event System Simulation by J. Banks, J.S. Carson II, B.L. Nelson and D.M. Nicol Simulation by S.M. Ross\nThese textbooks are at a similar level to the suggested textbook.\n Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering by P. Glasserman\nThis book is for advanced students, and while focused on financial engineering, is excellent reading in general.\n   All the above references are available online on the Cornell library website.\n Coding Resources: The assignments in the first half of semester can be done in any high-level language; our recommendation is for using Python (in particular, we will use Python 2.7 for our solutions) and Jupyter notebooks. These are installed in the labs in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall.\n For students using these for the first time, we highly recommend installing a packaga manager like Anaconda, which conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. The python tutorial is a good place to look up basic and advanced syntax. It should help you map other programming knowledge to Python, and learn the basic data types. Use library reference to find standard library modules to help get your work done quickly. The power of Python lies in the many packages that are available for different applications - we in particular will extensively use numpy, scipy and Matplotlib. Use (https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html\u0026quot;\u0026gt;library reference to find standard library modules to help get your work done quickly. Read numpy for MATLAB users if you are familiar with MATLAB. There are many more functions in scipy and numpy than you can remember. For a given task, you can look at the scipy reference or numpy reference to find the tool you are looking for. More generally, searching online for a task often brings up excellent suggestions in sites like StackExchange. Matplotlib has many built-in plotting capabilities. Usually, I use the matplotlib gallery to find something similar to what I want, and edit the code provided there. Another great visualization package is Seaborn.\nFor the second half of semester, we will use a commercial simulation package, Simio, which only operates on PCs, or on Macs running Windows. Simio is available in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall. Students may consider obtaining the student version of Simio ($25, available here - this imposes limits on the size of the models, but should be sufficient for the homework or project. The Simio software includes documentation.    Prerequisites Familiarity with the topics covered in ENGRD 2700 and ORIE 3500\u0026frasl;5500 is required, but ORIE 3500\u0026frasl;5500 may be taken concurrently. The initial part of the course includes a short review of probability and statistics, which is in essence the material in Chapter 4 Review of Probability and Statistics - of the suggested textbook by Law (see below). If this material is unfamiliar to you, then you might study Chapters 1 through 6 of Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, 2nd ed., by Sheldon Ross, or Chapters 1-5 and Chapter 7 of Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences, 8th ed., by Devore. This material is very standard, and can be found in other books at a similar level.\nThe course involves some coding, and some prior programming experience is useful. The programming in the first part of the course can be done using any high-level language of your choice (in particular, Python, MATLAB, R, Julia, C++ or Java); our preference is that students use Python, and submit iPython notebooks with annotated code and plots. There will be a recitation section introducing these for interested students, and students can use them in the lab computers in 571 Rhodes Hall and 453 Rhodes Hall. The second half of the course will be based on Simio, a commercial simulation package, which we will teach in class.\n","date":1503187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513468800,"objectID":"134eb9569d1a24ddb2b7c1d301df4a59","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/courses/orie4580f17/","publishdate":"2017-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/public/courses/orie4580f17/","section":"courses","summary":"Course Description Simulation is a general technique for answering \u0026lsquo;what-if questions\u0026rsquo; about complex real-world systems using computer-generated models.

These externalities are well captured by steady-state Markovian models, which are therefore widely used to analyze such systems. However, using such models to design pricing/control policies is computationally difficult since the resulting optimization problems are high-dimensional and non-convex. To this end, we develop a general approximation framework for designing pricing policies in shared vehicle systems, based on a novel convex relaxation which we term elevated flow relaxation. Our approach provides the first efficient algorithms with rigorous approximation guarantees for a wide range of objective functions (throughput, revenue, welfare). For any shared vehicle system with n stations and m vehicles, our framework provides a pricing policy with an approximation ratio of 1+(n−1)/m. This guarantee is particularly meaningful when m/n, the average number of vehicles per station is large, as is often the case in practice. Further, the simplicity of our approach allows us to extend it to more complex settings: rebalancing empty vehicles, redirecting riders to nearby vehicles, multi-objective settings (such as Ramsey pricing), incorporating travel-times, etc. Our approach yields efficient algorithms with the same approximation guarantees for all these problems, and in the process, obtains as special cases several existing heuristics and asymptotic guarantees.","tags":["online decision-making","market-design"],"title":"Pricing and Optimization in Shared Vehicle Systems: An Approximation Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur Gorokh","Siddhartha Banerjee","Krishnamurthy Iyer"],"categories":null,"content":"Results merged with follow-up paper into journal article.\n","date":1480568400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480568400,"objectID":"027cdef89a8f0d9532f9bbf27f984c51","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/gorokh-16-near/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/gorokh-16-near/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the design of mechanisms without money for repeated allocation of resources among competing agents.

This results in an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items are small, or admit some underlying structure; it is unclear, however, if good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with unstructured content. We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of items and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an 'access-graph' constrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that the presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible -- however this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage of the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of 'serendipity' in exploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of recommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple policies like Twitter's 'Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance. From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of 'trials' and 'strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the same order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for the worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon settings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph. Conversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly sub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal.","tags":["online decision-making"],"title":"Online Collaborative-Filtering on Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Lofgren","Siddhartha Banerjee","Ashish Goel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451624400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451624400,"objectID":"02e3cce0f0c268778c43d3610f98fee3","permalink":"https://sidbanerjee.github.io/public/publication/lofgren-16-bidirectional/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/public/publication/lofgren-16-bidirectional/","section":"publication","summary":"We present new algorithms for Personalized PageRank estimation and Personalized PageRank search.

We develop a new algorithm based on our bidirectional PPR estimator which identifies the most relevant results by sampling candidates based on their PPR; this is the first solution to PPR search that can find the best results without iterating through the set of all candidate results.

To answer this, we study the problem of learning item-clusters under local differential privacy, a powerful, formal notion of data privacy. We develop bounds on the sample-complexity of learning item-clusters from privatized user inputs. Significantly, our results identify a sample-complexity separation between learning in an information-rich and an information-scarce regime, thereby highlighting the interaction between privacy and the amount of information (ratings) available to each user. In the information-rich regime, where each user rates at least a constant fraction of items, a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve a sample-complexity lower bound derived from a simple information-theoretic argument based on Fano's inequality. However, the information-scarce regime, where each user rates only a vanishing fraction of items, is found to require a fundamentally different approach both for lower bounds and algorithms. To this end, we develop new techniques for bounding mutual information under a notion of channel-mismatch. These techniques may be of broader interest, and we illustrate this by applying them to (i) learning based on 1-bit sketches, and (ii) adaptive learning. Finally, we propose a new algorithm, MaxSense, and show that it achieves optimal sample-complexity in the information-scarce regime.","tags":["information structures"],"title":"The Price of Privacy in Untrusted Recommendation Engines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":" Course Description We will study a collection of interesting stochastic algorithms and models, that serve to illustrate the following idea:\nSize is a critical consideration in the design of useful stochastic models and algorithms.\nA formal way to express this is through the notion of scaling - given a model/algorithm for some system, how does it behave when we grow some aspect of the system.

This helps prevent duplication of work; however there is evidence that existing reward structures in research discourage partial-progress sharing. Ensuring PPS is especially important for new online collaborative-research platforms, which involve many researchers working on large, multi-stage problems. We study the problem of incentivizing information-sharing in research, under a stylized model: non-identical agents work independently on subtasks of a large project, with dependencies between subtasks captured via an acyclic subtask-network. Each subtask carries a reward, given to the first agent who publicly shares its solution. Agents can choose which subtasks to work on, and more importantly, when to reveal solutions to completed subtasks. Under this model, we uncover the strategic rationale behind certain anecdotal phenomena. Moreover, for any acyclic subtask-network, and under a general model of agent-subtask completion times, we give sufficient conditions that ensure PPS is incentive-compatible for all agents. One surprising finding is that rewards which are approximately proportional to perceived task-difficulties are sufficient to ensure PPS in all acyclic subtask-networks. The fact that there is no tension between local fairness and global information-sharing in multi-stage projects is encouraging, as it suggests practical mechanisms for real-world settings. Finally, we show that PPS is necessary, and in many cases, sufficient, to ensure a high rate of progress in research.","tags":["market-design","information structures"],"title":"Re-incentivizing discovery: Mechanisms for partial-progress sharing in research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Lofgren","Siddhartha Banerjee","Ashish Goel","C.

Such a constraint is motivated by modern social networks, wherein messages are broadcast to all neighbors, but attention spans are limited. Bounded susceptibility also arises in distributed computing applications with download bandwidth constraints, and in human epidemics under quarantine policies. Network epidemics have been extensively studied in literature; prior work characterizes the graph structures required to ensure fast spreading under the SI dynamics, and long lifetime under the SIS dynamics. In particular, these conditions turn out to be meaningful for two classes of networks of practical relevance -- dense, uniform (i.e., clique-like) graphs, and sparse, structured (i.e., star-like) graphs. We show that bounded susceptibility has a surprising impact on epidemic behavior in these graph families. For the SI dynamics, bounded susceptibility has no effect on star-like networks, but dramatically alters the spreading time in clique-like networks. In contrast, for the SIS dynamics, clique-like networks are unaffected, but star-like networks exhibit a sharp change in extinction times under bounded susceptibility. Our findings are useful for the design of disease-resistant networks and infrastructure networks. More generally, they show that results for existing epidemic models are sensitive to modeling assumptions in non-intuitive ways, and suggest caution in directly using these as guidelines for real systems.","tags":["online decision-making"],"title":"The behavior of epidemics under bounded susceptibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee"," A.Chatterjee","S.

To this end, we define a class of functions, the Fully-Multiplexible functions, which includes several functions such as parity, MAX, and k$^{th}$-order statistics. For such functions we exactly characterize the maximum achievable refresh rate of the network in terms of an underlying graph primitive, the min-mincut. In acyclic wireline networks, we show that the maximum refresh rate is achievable by a simple algorithm that is dynamic, distributed, and only dependent on local information. In the case of wireless networks, we provide a MaxWeight-like algorithm with dynamic flow splitting, which is shown to be throughput-optimal.","tags":["online decision-making"],"title":"Towards a queueing-based framework for in-network function computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

This leads to inconsistency in the views of the network across nodes, which, coupled with interference, makes it challenging to schedule for high throughputs.\n\n We characterize the network throughput region for this setup, and develop optimal scheduling policies to achieve the same. Our scheduling policies have a threshold-based structure and, moreover, require the nodes to use only the ?smallest critical subset? of the available delayed NSI to make decisions. In addition, using Markov chain mixing techniques, we quantify the impact of delayed NSI on the throughput region. This not only highlights the value of extra NSI for scheduling, but also characterizes the loss in throughput incurred by lower complexity scheduling policies which use homogeneously delayed NSI.","tags":["online decision-making"],"title":"On distributed scheduling with heterogeneously delayed network-state information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siddhartha Banerjee","Nidhi Hegde","Laurent Massoulié"],"categories":null,"content":"Journal version: Banerjee et al.

To answer this, we study the problem of learning item-clusters under local differential privacy, a powerful, formal notion of data privacy. We develop bounds on the sample-complexity of learning item-clusters from privatized user inputs. Significantly, our results identify a sample-complexity separation between learning in an information-rich and an information-scarce regime, thereby highlighting the interaction between privacy and the amount of information (ratings) available to each user. In the information-rich regime, where each user rates at least a constant fraction of items, a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve a sample-complexity lower bound derived from a simple information-theoretic argument based on Fano's inequality. However, the information-scarce regime, where each user rates only a vanishing fraction of items, is found to require a fundamentally different approach both for lower bounds and algorithms. To this end, we develop new techniques for bounding mutual information under a notion of channel-mismatch. These techniques may be of broader interest, and we illustrate this by applying them to (i) learning based on 1-bit sketches, and (ii) adaptive learning. Finally, we propose a new algorithm, MaxSense, and show that it achieves optimal sample-complexity in the information-scarce regime.","tags":["information structures"],"title":"The Price of Privacy in Untrusted Recommendation Engines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.
