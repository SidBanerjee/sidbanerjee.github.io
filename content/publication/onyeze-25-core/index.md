abstract: "We consider the problem of repeatedly allocating multiple shareable public goods that have limited availability in an online setting without the use of money. In our setting, agents have additive values, and the value each agent receives from getting access to the goods in each period is drawn i.i.d. from some joint distribution that can be arbitrarily correlated between agents. The principal also has global constraints on the set of goods they can select over the horizon, which is represented via a submodular allocation-cost function. Our goal is to select the periods to allocate the good to ensure high value for each group of agents. We develop mechanisms for this problem using an artificial currency, where we give each agent a budget proportional to their (exogenous) fair share."
