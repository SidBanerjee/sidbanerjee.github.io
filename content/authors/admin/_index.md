I am an associate professor in the [School of Operations Research and Information Engineering](http://www.orie.cornell.edu/) (ORIE) at Cornell, as well as a field member in Departments of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/), [ECE](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/), and the [Center for Applied Mathematics](http://www.cam.cornell.edu/). 

I work on topics at the intersection of data-driven decision-making and stochastic control, economics and computation, and large-scale network algorithms. Some of my current research interests include:

* New data-driven approaches for online decision-making [[seminar]](https://sites.google.com/view/snappseminar/past-seminars/spring-2021#h.1d7o5iajoo6j) 
* Non-monetary mechanisms and information design [[seminar]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lccoYzqmsAU)
* Equity and fairness in online decision-making [[seminar]](https://vod.video.cornell.edu/media/3.12.21+Sid+Banerjee%2C+Cornell+University/1_clje1p9x)
* Stochastic coupling techniques in control (tutorial: [[part 1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GB7I6-lym8), [[part 2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kbr2N49-Bo))


Prior to Cornell, I received my PhD from the [ECE Department](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at UT Austin, and was a postdoctoral researcher at [Stanford MS&E](http://web.stanford.edu/group/soal/). I also served as technical consultant at [Lyft](http://lyft.com/) in 2014-18, where I helped develop and implement Lyft's primetime pricing; the following [tutorial](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/banerjee-ridesharing) and [book chapter](publication/ridesharechapter-19) give an overview of my work on ridesharing platforms. 


I am currently on sabbatical at the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) in Berkeley as a co-organizer of the program on [Data-Driven Decision-Making](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/DataDriven2022).
